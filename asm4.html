        “Shop Together” targets two persona types, given the problem statements will focus on --- “How might we make IG shops which sell fashion items but with less than 10k followers (who) address the problems of low exposure and inconvenient order management (what) to achieve the goals of improving shop awareness and sales (why)?”, and “How might we make young online shopping lovers who spend $500 or above monthly on IG shops (who) address the problems of hardly finding interested IG shops or products (what) to achieve the goals of saving time in searching and a better online shopping experience (why)?”.

        In addition, the solution aims to develop a one-stop platform business model for IG shop owners who have suffered from low exposure on Instagram to easily find and collaborate with other shops in terms of joint-store promotion on the website and check the analytics data of their shops so that their exposure and sales could be better improved. While young online shopping lovers could not only save time on finding the interested products or shops, but also enjoy special offers such as free delivery and exclusive discount. Now, they can enjoy the above benefits by simply joining the platform (paid monthly subscription). To further narrow the scope, the platform targets the Hong Kong market to test first.

        In order to verify the effectiveness of the business strategy of compelling the targeted persona types to subscribe to the platform membership, a usability test will also be performed.
