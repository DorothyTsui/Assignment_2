      <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
      <p>This is my first assignment of COMM5961 that I have created this website to
        compose all the 5 assignments. This is my first time that I have ever developed
        my own website and it is hoped that I can present it as a portfolio when I am applying
        for jobs in the future.
        <br><br>
        As an undergraduate student in social sciences, it is always so exciting for me to
        learn something new other than my fields, especially knowledge or skills related to
        technology and computer science. It is never easy to learn and master a new skill,
        I would say that learning by doing is the one and only way for me.
        <br><br>
        By doing this assignment, I realized that I still have been confused about some concepts
        which I had learned from previous lectures. This practical task has undoubtedly refreshed
        my knowledge and skills. I would like to share more about why and how I have developed
        the website like this, and some difficulties that I encountered to not only keep a
        record of my working flow but also try to communicate with others.
